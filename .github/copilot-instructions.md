# AccessCity — Copilot Instructions

## 1. Project Overview

AccessCity is a civic-tech initiative focused on improving urban accessibility through structured community-driven data collection and collaboration with public institutions.

The platform enables citizens to report accessibility barriers and accessible points in cities, transforming these reports into structured, actionable datasets that municipalities and organizations can use to improve urban inclusion.

The initiative prioritizes:

- Accessibility-first design
- Data structure over complaint-style reporting
- Measurable impact
- Municipal collaboration
- Scalability across cities

Tagline:
Don’t ask where. Start asking what’s next.

## 2. Core Problem

Urban accessibility issues are:

- Poorly documented
- Scattered
- Unstructured
- Often invisible to decision makers

Examples include:

- Broken sidewalks
- Missing ramps
- Steep slopes
- Narrow entrances
- Lack of accessible toilets
- Temporary obstacles

AccessCity transforms isolated observations into structured, categorized, and actionable urban accessibility data.

## 3. Product Direction

The platform should:

- Be mobile-first
- Be fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Use semantic HTML
- Be keyboard navigable
- Support screen readers
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Maintain strong color contrast
- Avoid unnecessary animations
- Load fast and work on low-end devices

Accessibility is a core requirement, not a feature.

## 4. Target Users

Primary:

- People with mobility challenges
- Caregivers
- Disability advocacy groups

Secondary:

- Municipalities
- Urban planners
- Public infrastructure departments
- NGOs

Tertiary:

- Businesses interested in accessibility compliance

All features should consider these user groups.

## 5. Architectural Principles

When generating code, Copilot should:

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid heavy dependencies unless necessary
- Keep solutions scalable
- Avoid tight coupling
- Use clean data models
- Favor predictable state management
- Avoid accessibility-breaking UI patterns
- Avoid div-heavy non-semantic layouts
- Prefer progressive enhancement

If a tradeoff exists:
Accessibility and clarity win over visual complexity.

## 6. Data Philosophy

Accessibility data must be:

- Structured
- Categorized
- Severity-aware
- Geo-located
- Filterable
- Actionable

Do NOT treat reports as generic “comments” or “posts”.
They are structured civic data entries.

---

## 7. UX Guidelines

Tone:

- Professional
- Calm
- Human-centered
- Evidence-based
- Forward-looking

Avoid:

- Alarmist language
- Political bias
- Confrontational rhetoric

The product supports collaboration, not conflict.

---

## 8. Business Context

AccessCity aims to:

- Partner with municipalities
- Provide dashboards and analytics
- Enable data-driven urban planning
- Potentially integrate with smart city infrastructure

Future features may include:

- Heatmaps
- Municipal dashboards
- Exportable reports
- API integrations
- Accessibility audit modules

Code should be written with scalability in mind.

## 9. SEO & Web Standards

All public-facing pages must:

- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include structured data (Schema.org)
- Avoid duplicated content
- Be fully responsive
- Avoid layout shifts
- Optimize for performance

---

## 10. Long-Term Vision

AccessCity aims to become:

A structured accessibility data layer for cities.

The system should evolve toward:

- Cross-city datasets
- Standardized accessibility metrics
- Institutional-grade dashboards
- Policy influence through measurable impact

All development decisions should align with this long-term direction.
